# Progress

**What Works:**
- **Dual-Server Automation:** `start-analysis.sh` and `stop-analysis.sh` are fully functional, handling server creation/deletion, volume attachment/detachment, and code updates.
- **Fetcher Safety:** `run_update.sh` now manages `/tmp/poly-fetcher.lock` to signal busy status, preventing the automation scripts from interrupting a running fetch.
- **Data Safety:** The automation includes a critical safety check that prevents the analyzer from being deleted if there are uncommitted Git changes.
- **Persistent Environment:** The `poly-fetcher` correctly saves and restores `tmux` sessions across reboots using `tmux-continuum`.
- **Data Pipeline:** The core data collection (`update_all.py`) continues to run reliably on the fetcher. Optimized with tail scanning.
- **Infrastructure:** The split architecture (permanent fetcher, on-demand analyzer, shared volume) is fully implemented and snapshotted.
- **Git Hygiene:** Log files removed, `.gitignore` updated, changes merged to `master`.

**What's Left to Build:**
- **Data Analysis:** Begin the trading analysis in the Jupyter notebooks.

**Current Status:**
- The entire infrastructure and automation suite is built, deployed, and verified. The project is operationally ready.

**Key Fixes & Learnings:**
- **Safety First in Automation:** Automating the destruction of resources (like deleting the analyzer server) carries high risk. Adding a "Git Safety Check" to the shutdown script was a critical enhancement to prevent the accidental loss of code changes.
- **Architectural Journey & Clarification:** The project's architecture underwent several clarifications.
    1. The initial plan was a dual-server model (fetcher + on-demand analyzer).
    2. A misunderstanding led to a temporary pivot to a single, resizable server model.
    3. The user ultimately confirmed the desire for the more robust **dual-server model**. This was a critical lesson in ensuring shared understanding before implementing infrastructure, as it significantly changed the setup and automation logic.
- **SSH Debugging:** A lengthy debugging session to resolve an SSH `Permission denied` error on the analyzer server revealed multiple root causes in sequence: an incorrect assumption about key corruption, a missing key file, and finally a shell-specific globbing error (`zsh: no matches found`). This highlighted the need for systematic, evidence-based troubleshooting.
- **`uv` Installer Changes:** Discovered that the `uv` installer's default path changed from `~/.cargo/bin` to `~/.local/bin`, requiring updates to setup scripts and environment configuration.
